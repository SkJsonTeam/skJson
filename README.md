## ðŸ’¡ What's New in SkJson?

The new version of SkJson is currently a **Work in Progress (WIP)**. Our goal is to make JSON handling in Skript easier and more efficient than ever before. This release will feature major improvements in terms of performance, usability, and compatibility, providing you with a seamless experience for all your scripting needs.

### Key Improvements:

- **Java 21+ Compatibility**: SkJson now requires Java 21 or higher, ensuring that the addon takes full advantage of the latest performance improvements and language features.
- **Skript 2.9.2+ Compatibility**: Updated compatibility to require Skript 2.9.2+, providing better support and additional features that enhance your scripting workflow.
- **Enhanced JSON Parsing**: The new version significantly optimizes JSON parsing using GSON, resulting in faster and more reliable JSON handling.
- **Modular Architecture**: SkJson has been redesigned to offer a more modular architecture, making it easier to extend functionalities and customize the addon to fit your needs.
- **Improved Error Handling**: Added detailed error messages and handling mechanisms to make debugging easier and to provide more insight into what might go wrong during JSON operations.
- **Better Performance**: With the new Java version requirements, SkJson utilizes improved garbage collection and other JVM enhancements to boost performance, especially when dealing with large JSON structures.
- **Streamlined API**: The API has been simplified to reduce complexity. Many methods have been refined to provide a more intuitive experience for developers.

### Upcoming Features:

- **File Handling Improvements**: Expect better integration for reading, writing, and updating JSON files with more control and options.
- **Skript/Bukkit Object Serialization**: Enhanced capabilities for converting Bukkit and Skript objects directly into JSON and vice versa, making it even easier to work with in-game data.
- **Advanced Request Handling**: Improved support for HTTP requests, including additional methods (POST, PUT, DELETE) with simplified syntax and more customization options.
- **Async JSON Operations**: Support for asynchronous JSON processing to prevent lag during heavy JSON operations and to improve server responsiveness.

Stay tuned for the upcoming features and examples that will make working with JSON more powerful and intuitive!
